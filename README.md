## My process
Starting this project I wasn't 100% sure where to start   so I started with looking at the styles the website should have. After checking the fonts and colors from the style guide and seeing the design templates I started to realise what I should do. Adding in some html made the base structure of the website which made it easy to visualize what I wanted to create and after that I only really had to add some elements in Css and move them around.   

### Built with

HTML
CSS


### What I learned

This being my third website I've build and used to hone my skills in Html + Css.  I'd say I gained confidence in building basic websites with Html and adding some flare to them with css.


### Continued development

As mentioned above this being one of my early projects I'd like to improve all around on Html and Css.
